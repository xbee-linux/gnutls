  The GnuTLS package contains libraries and userspace tools which provide a secure layer over a reliable transport layer. Currently the GnuTLS library implements the proposed standards by the IETF's TLS working group. Quoting from the TLS protocol specification:
  “The TLS protocol provides communications privacy over the Internet. The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.”
  GnuTLS provides support for TLS 1.3, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0, and SSL 3.0 protocols, TLS extensions, including server name and max record size. Additionally, the library supports authentication using the SRP protocol, X.509 certificates and OpenPGP keys, along with support for the TLS Pre-Shared-Keys (PSK) extension, the Inner Application (TLS/IA) extension and X.509 and OpenPGP certificate handling.
  Installed Programs: certtool, danetool, gnutls-cli, gnutls-cli-debug, gnutls-serv, ocsptool, p11tool, psktool, and srptool
  Installed Libraries: libgnutls.so, libgnutls-dane.so, libgnutlsxx.so, and libgnutls-openssl.so (optional)
  Installed Directories: /usr/include/gnutls, /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/gnutls, and /usr/share/doc/gnutls-3.7.3
  Short Descriptions
    certtool: is used to generate X.509 certificates, certificate requests, and private keys
    danetool: is a tool used to generate and check DNS resource records for the DANE protocol
    gnutls-cli: is a simple client program to set up a TLS connection to some other computer
    gnutls-cli-debug: is a simple client program to set up a TLS connection to some other computer and produces very verbose progress results
    gnutls-serv: is a simple server program that listens to incoming TLS connections
    ocsptool: is a program that can parse and print information about OCSP requests/responses, generate requests and verify responses
    p11tool: is a program that allows handling data from PKCS #11 smart cards and security modules
    psktool: is a simple program that generates random keys for use with TLS-PSK
    srptool: is a simple program that emulates the programs in the Stanford SRP (Secure Remote Password) libraries using GnuTLS
    libgnutls.so: contains the core API functions and X.509 certificate API functions
